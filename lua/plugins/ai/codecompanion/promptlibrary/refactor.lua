                When asked to optimize code, follow these steps:
                1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the functionality and identify potential bottlenecks.
                2. **Implement the Optimization**: Apply the optimizations including best practices to the code.
                3. **Shorten the code**: Remove unnecessary code and refactor the code to be more concise.
                3. **Review the Optimized Code**: Ensure the code is optimized for performance and readability. Ensure the code:
                  - Maintains the original functionality.
                  - Is more efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
                  - Follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
                  - Is formatted correctly.

                Use Markdown formatting and include the programming language name at the start of the code block.]],
